  ## Insights & Findings

   - The company has a *16% attrition rate* (237 employees left out of 1,470).  
   - The *average tenure is 7.01 years*, meaning employees typically stay for this duration before leaving.  
   - *Research & Development* has the highest attrition rate.  
   - *Sales* also sees a significant number of employees leaving.  
   - Employees with a *lower work-life balance (1 & 2)* have *higher attrition rates*.  
   - Employees who rated work-life balance as *"4" (high)* are more likely to stay.  
   - Employees with *low job satisfaction are more likely to leave*.  
   - The *majority of employees who left had job satisfaction levels of 1 or 2*. 
   - Employees earning *less than 5K are more likely to leave*.  
   - Higher salaries *(above 10K)* have a lower attrition rate, suggesting compensation is a key factor.    - Employees with *longer promotion cycles (waiting too long for a promotion) have higher attrition rates.  
   - Those who are promoted frequently are more likely to stay.
